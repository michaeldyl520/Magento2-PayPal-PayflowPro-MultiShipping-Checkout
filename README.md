# Magento2-PayPal-PayflowPro-MultiShipping-Checkout
Using this extension, you can use "PayPal PayflowPro" payment method at Multi Shipping checkout.

PayPal Payflow Pro Payment Gateway is a service that sends credit card information from a website to the credit card payment networks for processing, and returns transaction details and responses from the payment networks back to the website. In this method credit card information is sent or from a checkout page hosted on your own website.

To use this extension you need to have a PayPal Payflow Pro account. If you don't have an account then you can sign up for a new account.

Features and Pricing for using PayPal Payflow Pro can be found out here.

 

Almost every payment gateway has transaction fees. PayPal Payflow pro also has transaction fees. Detailed information regarding transaction fees of the gateway can be found out here.

Currently, there is no solution or extension/custom code available using which we can use "PayPal Payflow Pro" payment method in Multi Shipping (Checkout with Multiple address) checkout. To overcome this limitation we have developed this extension. PayPal PayflowPro Multi Shipping is an extension for Magento 2 using which store owners can use the "PayPal Payflow Pro" payment gateway in Multi Shipping Checkout into the website (Checkout with Multiple address). Using this extension will allow the store administrator to enable and use "PayPal Payflow Pro" as a payment method in Multi Shipping checkout.

By Default in Magento 1. x versions "PayPal Payflow Pro" payment method was available in the Multi Shipping (Checkout with Multiple address) checkout as well in OnePage (Normal) Checkout. There are was no need for any custom extension or code. But now in Magento 2. x this payment method is only available in the OnePage (Regular) Checkout method. The Multi Shipping method (Checkout with Multiple address) in Magento 2. x currently only supports "Cash on Delivery" payment method as of now.

The main benefit of the extension is that user with zero/partial knowledge of coding (user with basic knowledge of handling Magento) can use this plugin with ease. All things are configurable and user does not need to code or make changes in any of the files. Also, we have a good documentation that would certainly help/assist you if needed.
